# GENERAL
- [x] Look for a implementation of DkNN on github, if this exists we may be able to save a lot of time.

# GEODESIC DISTANCE EXPLORATION
- [x] Approximate geodesic distances using Dijsktra's shortest paths over Swiss Roll.
- [x] Make toy example to prove the viability of the approach using a synthetic manifold and a classification problem. Check this paper for reference of manifold http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/papers/zgl.pdf.

# BEGIN SEARCH FOR FEASIBLE DIJSKTRA's
- [x] Check paper on local similarity hashing functions. This approach might be just available for euclidean distances.
- [x] Look for approximation to shortest paths algorithms to prepare scalability.
